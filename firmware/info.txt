This folder contains firmware written for various printable circuit boards (PCBs), primarily written with the STM32CubeIDE. 

Firmware is divided by board, and if there are corresponding hostside scripts, those are included both with the firmware and in the "scripts" folder.

A summary of each board's function is included in their folder.
