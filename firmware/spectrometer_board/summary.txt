This board was developed for the Cornell Mars Rover project team. 

While the PCB design was created by another member, I wrote the board firmware and the Python script used to collect data.

The board firmware is stored in the folder "spectro_take2".
The python script is the file "spectrometer_collection.py". 

The board functions as follows:

A sample is fed through a notch in the board past a photodiode, which collects data sent back to the board's microcontroller. 
The board translates that data into voltage then sends each sample to the host computer via CAN. 
The Python script then decodes that message and stores each data point in a .csv file.

This board is currently optimized for testing purposes, which is why there are no start/stop signals. 
For competition, data collection will be optimized for quick analysis.
